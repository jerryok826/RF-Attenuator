## Project Description
I always liked the HP/Agilent 355 Step Attenuators. Now with Kicad and low cost PCB fabrication I thought I just design my own. The attenuator uses BNC connector rather than SMA beause I like the quick disconnet feature. The design is base on 1watt resistors so that the power limit. Total Attenuation is 62DB in 1 DB steps.

### Project Status
The project is complete and has be verifyed with a Rigol DSA816 spectrum analyer from 1MHz to 30MHz.

## Design Files
### Electrical Design Files
This project was designed with Kicad 7.X
